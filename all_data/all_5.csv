Community,"Baleska, We agree with you and according to the law, every Honduran has a right to eat! But, this quantity is not for personal consumption. These species are vital species for maintaining the health of the reef and for TOURISM...Parrotfish, Goatfish, Lobster, Angelfish and let's not forget that this is the same case that speared the baby green turtle! It's all fine and dandy supporting people that need to feed their families but let's not compare apples to oranges with artisanal fishing (poaching) and commercial fishing that is supplying restaurants!"
