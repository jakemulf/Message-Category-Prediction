Community,"Hello everyone thanks for all your comments. We do patrols during day and also strategic at night some of them are by land others by sea. We try to change our strategies because believe or not poachers are very creative and always find new ways to do their activities. Our rangers normally as soon the capture live organisms the free them around the area that they got them now in this case in my position as Director and coordinator of patrols and seeing the different methods they used I asked the ranger to bring them to West End so I could inspect the animals, take pictures of them in and out the bag and write an adequate report, I decided to release them on Half Moon Bay to avoid more stress to them. Now I want to be clear that this is not a common approach we do believe in releasing them close to the area they where found and we spread them, the only other time we move them is when they are in the popular poaching sites then we find other site where we can insure their survival. I ask the community to not only report this cases to us but also make sure that if poaches come close to your beach let them know that you wont tolerate their activities. Only together we will make a difference. RMP main objective is preserving the Islands treasures and will work hard to achieve it. Thank You for understanding and great job to our ranger that found this bags and conch."

Community,"Not so friendly photo of the week! But as much of you may have noticed in your newsfeed, the shark slaughter has begun. Please do what you can in your community, sign a petition, let any restaurant that serves shark fin soup know why you will not eat in their establishment. Every little bit helps and hopefully we can avoid the unnecessary slaughter!"
