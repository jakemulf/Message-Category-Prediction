Community,"As for the plastic law, it states that companies that import must either make it easy for removal (recycling) or be taxed per unit. They have made an effort to offer recycling and pay for not only their plastic but cans as well. This DOES NOT include the picking up of the plastic... just the effort to remove it from the island... they are the MAIN reason why Roatan recycles anything... just the yes this is a sneaky way but those are our laws and unfortunately it gives the companies loopholes and even if it was perfectly enforced by the municipality it still would not solve the plastic and trash on our beaches and streets! That is where the communities of Roatan must step up and help out ourselves... if we dont help and respect ourselves, who will?? and why would they?"

Community,Aaron Thacker Any other spears are illegal within the Bay Islands National Marine Park in order to protect vulnerable species that have become so used to snorkelers and divers. We have so many visitors a year that groupers and snappers no longer swim away. \nThe lionfish licensing workshop is a very simple evaluation of good buoyancy and common sense. It is also used to share cleaning techniques and offer opportunities to local communities on where and how they can sell their catch!
