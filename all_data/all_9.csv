Community,"Clay Fowler I will give you a bit of background. There is an Acuerdo (002-2004 art. 35) that states that no plastics, bottles, bags or packaging shall be introduced into The Bay Islands without the necessary removal efforts in place. As of June of this year we have had the 4 biggest supermarkets ban plastic bags. They are now slowly and surely bringing them back as there are no municipal sanctions in place, even though we have had this Acuerdo since 2004! \nWe, the RMP, want to show the municipality the support this initiative has from the communities. \nSo I ask again... would you sign a petition to save our ecosystems?"

To enable them to feed their families, we took the trash and them to Coxen Hole where they were able to sell the plastic. Hopefully we won't find these guys back on the reef, but if we do, we know where lots of trash still is."

Here are the guys from Ocean Connections Dive Shop who are now legally able to do their part in reducing lionfish populations and get a snack out of it as well. If you know of any local divers or snorkelers who are interested in getting their license, please contact us so we can organize a workshop."
Information,"Dear Jon, Thank you for generating the opportunity to clarify your points in an objective manner.\n1. Performance requirements are limited to buoyancy control and proper aiming and shooting skills with the Hawaiian Slings. Additionally, we have a liability release form which also states that you are aware that the Hawaiian Sling is intended for lionfish and lionfish only, and that if you are caught with anything else, you\u2019ll be in trouble.\n2. The most immediate sites to be impacted are those located within the Sandy Bay \u2013 West End area and also on the Southside from West all the way East bordering Oakridge; this shoreline, all the way until 60 m below sea level. Other project regarding lionfish control is being started with Punta Gorda (North-East) community members. \nAlthough the above are represents RMP\u2019s immediate jurisdiction boundaries, the new regulations are being designed to fit within a general Management Plan for the whole Bay Islands National Marine Park (all three islands). Therefore, one of the main drivers of change regarding for the Lionfish Program is the need to standardize the program within the three islands.\n3. Unfortunately, lionfish data from independent lionfish hunters is hard to standardize and make plausible conclusions based on it. But, lionfish population data is indeed being collected by the RMP along with other institutional partners through a monitoring system called AGRRA (Atlantic and Rapid Reef Assesment). Through this periodic monitoring system we evaluate the reef\u2019s health based on distinct indicators classified into benthic cover, invert biota, commercial fish biomass, and herbivorous fish biomass. Lionfish population is accounted for here. In the West \u2013 North portion of Roatan we have 8 permanent monitoring sites. \nThe data above is being collected and important publications are already available online (http://www.healthyreefs.org/index.php/en/)\nAt the moment, we are developing parallel monitoring systems regarding poaching pressure in order to correlate patrolling efficiency & reef\u2019s health, in a way where we may actually quantify our management success or failure, and to promote adaptive management based on pertinent scientific data.\nWe have no scientific conclusions regarding lionfish impact yet, but on a subjective appreciation we do recognize that populations have been declaiming within popular dive sites where lionfish hunters are active. \n4. Data to be collected after the new rules are enforced will depend only in the willingness of the licensed hunters to provide it \u2013 we have the intention of developing and promoting an interactive webpage were you may login key data that will allow us to estimate catch rates vs. man/hour effort in specific sites. \n 5. No data has been really collected from current lionfish hunters.\n6. We do need to be flexible and that is the spirit of our \u201cadaptive management concept\u201d, we change in response of objective experience.\n7. Lionfish numbers are clearly not the focus of these new rules, the damage being done to the reef by inexperienced divers with poor buoyancy control are the issue being addressed = RMP\u2019s point of view.\nOnce again Jon, thank you for your time in generating this important questions. I hope you may help us set these new rules in place and of course, I\u2019ll let you know when the lionfish hunter\u2019s portal is available for you to enter your own catch data. Best, Andr\xe9s."

Information,"It is clear that people who are not earning a living from all the tourism generated revenue here on Roatan rely on the sea as a source of food and income. What was once full of conch, lobster, turtles and fish, due to such an increase in the island's population, there are far fewer of all of these inhabitants on the reef. Overfishing is a huge problem here with juveniles of all species of fish harvested, along with the use of nets and spearguns. The reefs are struggling with this increased pressure and the future looks bleak if we don't work more on controlling the ever increasing population who fail to receive the education and awareness which would change their attitude towards the reefs"

We are currently working on a bee project with the community from Corozal, however there are dozens of other communities that need help. many people don't actually own the land they live on and have already illegally cleared the neighbouring hillsides for farming so these programs would be tricky to supervise.
