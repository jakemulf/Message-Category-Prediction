Information,"Every year thousands of marine species die from contact with ocean-borne plastic bags. The animals may mistake the bags for food, such as jellyfish, or simply become entangled. Plastic bags can take up to 1,000 years to break down, so even when an animal dies and decays after ingesting a bag, the plastic re-enters the environment, posing a continuing threat to wildlife. \r\nWhile most plastic bags eventually break down into tiny particles, smaller sea creatures may still eat the sand-sized fragments and concentrate toxic chemicals in their bodies.\r\n\r\nTrying to reduce the use of plastic bags and its negative impact the RMP has of officially launched the Bags for Life Campaign.\r\nYou can purchase your Bag for Life at the RMP Eco - Store, Eldons supermarket, Mangiamo, and Plaza Mar.\r\n\r\nReduce your Footprint\r\n\r\nSay no to Plastic!!!"

Information,"Yesterday, Nov 11th, there was an incident involving a large fishing boat. The boat had traveled to Roat\xe1n and was collecting sea cucumbers around French Key. \nUpon receiving several calls from concerned residents, the RMP patrol boat approached the boat, which was acting like a mother ship for smaller \u201cCayucos\u201d (non-motored dories) delivering their catch. The Park Rangers, accompanied by RMP staff and the Municipal Police, ordered the captain to stop harvesting until the issue regarding proper permits and jurisdiction could be resolved. The cayucos were ordered to return to the boat and release their catch of sea cucumbers into the ocean. \n\nWe were unable to inspect the main vessel, as neither the RMP nor the Municipal Police are permitted to do so. According to the Management Plan for the Bay Islands National Marine Park, it is illegal to harvest and commercialize any seas cucumbers within the Bay Island\u2019s National Marine Park boundaries. However, the vessel had been issued a permit no. 092-2012, by the Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganaderia that house the Fisheries Department, from the mainland, allowing them to do so, therefore going against the regulations stated in the current and legal management plan.\n\nThe boat has now left the Bay Islands and the Roat\xe1n Marine Park has involved all the authorities, including the ministry of ICF and the ministry of Environment for upholding the laws of the management plan."
