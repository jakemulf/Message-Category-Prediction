Information,"Sea cucumbers, named for their resemblance to the vegetable cucumber, are echinoderms and are in the same phylum as starfish, sea urchins, and sand dollars. They are found at every ocean depth and worldwide there are approximately 1250 species. They can be anywhere from 3 millimetres to 1 metre in length but are typically 10-30cm long. \nSea cucumbers serve a useful purpose in the marine ecosystem as they help recycle nutrients. They are generally scavengers, feeding on decaying organic matter, however some feed on plankton. Therefore they play an integral part in marine ecosystems, almost similar to that of lobster and conch, and cannot be disregarded as being unimportant. \nFor centuries sea cucumbers have been harvested for human consumption with some species cultivated in commercial aquaculture systems. They are mostly exported in a dried form, but a small quantity of fresh and frozen sea cucumber also enters into international trade. Nearly 90% are consumed in Southeast Asia and the Far East and in general consumption is associated with high quality dried and prepared/preserved seafood such as shark fins, abalone and other shellfish. In Dalian, the largest sea cucumber trading hub in China, the industry is estimated at $1.6 billion per year, meaning global estimates are much greater. \nIn the past year, with the closure of the lobster diving fishery In Honduras, fishermen have been looking for alternatives and have heard of the possible riches in harvesting sea cucumbers. There have been numerous cases throughout Roatan of boats packed full of free divers collecting sea cucumbers and fortunately, on several occasions we were able to intervene and release the sea cumbers.  According to the Bay Islands Management Plan, it is illegal to remove and commercialize shells, hard and soft corals, seas cucumbers, starfish, sea urchins, seahorses, sponges, turtles, sharks and all sub products. This law is for the whole of the Bay Islands, therefore we ask that you report any boats or individuals collecting sea cucumbers so we can collaborate with the authorities and stop this from happening."

Community,"Good morning, \nThere are many theories behind what is best for the turtle's navigation and magnetism. What we do is give them a rest at Maya Key and then we will release them in the open ocean on some of the sargassum as to not mess with their established imprint of their natal beach. \nWe have yet to make a trip into the open ocean on one of these releases but we will have to soon as we have quite a few babies. \nSo, to answer your question, please bring them in or feel free to put them back but if you choose the latter please head out a couple miles so they don't get washed right back onto the beach!"

Community,"One is a simple data base of everyone that has been licensed to hunt lionfish. We have photos, names, contact info, spear number and expiration date.

It needs to have names,ages, photos, location, techniques and cross referenced in some way so we can search for offenders based on criteria in order to write reports."
