Information,"The graphs simply show amount generated through membership and user fee sales. Obviously there will be a difference between the large resorts and the smaller shops. Some shops make the user fee mandatory, others sometimes offer it to their guests, while sadly a few do not mention the fee. Comparing % of divers who buy the fee would be a more precise method of measurement but that would be an impossible figure to acquire"

Community,"Firstly we would like to thank all our supporters small and big. The only reason we have been around for almost 10 years is through local support. The reason why the ""user fee"" has never become mandatory by law as it would then be a tax and that money would be funneled directly to the Government and never make it back to the island. It is up to dive shops to promote the sale of the user fee to their customers who get to experience a healthy coral reef far superior to that of our neighbors"

Information,"When Jacques-Yves Cousteau first saw the blue ocean through a pair of glass goggles back in 1936, this where his thoughts:\n \n\u201cI was astounded by what I saw in the shallow shingle at Le Mourillon, rocks covered with green, brown and silver forests of algae and fishes unknown to me, swimming in crystalline water. Standing up to breathe I saw a trolley car, people, electric-light poles. I put my eyes under again and civilization vanished with one last bow. I was in a jungle never seen by those who floated on the opaque roof.\u201d\n \nThis is a gentle reminder that every time each of us ventures into our underwater jungles, we must behave properly, and demand that our companions do so as well, just as anyone would in an art museum \u2013 only seeing, never grabbing. Little by little, unsupervised people are impacting our delicate corals. \n\nIf we don\u2019t take supervision seriously, our submarine jungle will soon not look any better than an electric light pole in Coxen Hole!"

Information,"Well Chris, the Roatan Marine Park has been and is still very involved in improving Honduran Environmental Laws. Things don't change over night in first world countries so you can imagine how hard it can be here with lots of conflict of interest in many cases. The SAD photo you post its a true reality and we have extensive awareness programs with kids and we are just starting to create an awareness program thru diving and its not just something random this is the way for many local people to realize their treasure.  But the true strength of the RMP comes from the united effort of Hotels, Dive shops and other stake holders that depend of the Island. And let me just rephrase united. We have touched all the government levels that are in charge of actually punishing this acts and in this year we have had success on the response and prosecution. Strong fines had been given and some projects have been stopped. But as I mentioned before we need to work United and we cant stop all of the bad things that affect the reef but we definitely make a difference.We want to stop problems like this every one should together as part of this Island. If someone has a report contact us as soon as you can and we will gather information or  detain and then send it to the government office that has the responsibility prosecute, we will follow up. If you want to know more about all the activities, projects, funds, and government relations please contact us, or come to our general Assembly which will be in March and will post the exact date on our Facebook page. All together we make the difference not alone."

Information,Thanks for you concern. We have been observing this activity all ready because its new for us. Now as your link says they are working on regulations in the States so you can imagine here we have none. We have approached the owner/instructor and expressed to him that our main concern is the safety of who does the activity. This is because its been done on the navigation area of West Bay. Environmentally the risk is to the turtle grass but what I have been seeing is that he stays within the sand patch. We have expressed to him that he needs to stay away from the coral reef.

Information,"Last week our director was on the Atlantic coast of Guatemala in conjunction with Healthy Reefs Initiative, DIPESCA, Fundacion Mundo Azul and Waterquest dive shop teaching local fishermen the importance of sustainable fishing. \nThere was a strong emphasis in shark fishing/overfishing as it is the number one income for many coastal communities. \nFishermen were also taught how to monitor their waters by being trained in AGRRA (Atlantic Gulf coast Rapid Reef Assessment)\nMarine protected areas Sarstun and Punta de Manabique are our closest protected neighbours and have a direct impact on us and us on them.\nThe time spent was essential for the protection of the entire Mesoamerican Reef Region. The sooner we realize and understand that we are all connected and impacts are not localized the better off we will all be!"

Community,"Peter Hohaus if we used stronger, bigger slings there would be too much temptation to spear other things!"
Community,"We have been involved in inspections and reports of this particular tour provider for MONTHS and MONTHS. They somehow have been able to go around government officials and maintain open. Futhermore, asking tourists to be responsible is the least they can do. If we continue to have this type of unsustainable tourism WE WILL HAVE NO TOURISM in the next couple decades. Would you rather not have a dive destination next time you chose to visit?"
Information,"Wow, what a beautiful day. :) Keep a look out for any turtles or anything else cool that gets washed up to shore that shouldn't have. Please be nice and help them back into the sea. Thank you!"

Information,"Short Message to business owners prior to Semana Santa!\n\nThe Honduran Swan Islands constitute a chain of three small islands located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, approximately ninety miles off the Honduran coastline. They are the most isolated islands in the region, meaning that they are located as far away from any other island in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile on a scientific expedition, last July I had the privilege of visiting this remote place, hoping to encounter a pristine area where few people have ventured. Although the scene in the Northern portions of the islands where astoundingly beautiful, the story wasn\u2019t the same in the South Side. \n\nEven when only 6 navy officers actually live in the island, the South beaches where unexpectedly covered with plastic trash brought upon the currents. Our cultural bond with plastics is evidently taking the lead, destroying ecosystems and places that we might not even know about yet.\n\nWhether you own a business or not, the message for this Semana Santa, is for all of us to make a little sacrifice and accept to comply with this very simple recommendations.\n\nPlease don\u2019t sell plastic bottles! Alternatives are always there:\n\na. Sell refreshments in cans (which are more reciclable tan plastics).\n\nb. Serve sodas or beers in \u201ccarton\u201d cups, not plastics.\n\nc. If you which to sell water, buy enough 5 gallon containers and get a fountain \u2013 instead, sell re-fills.\n\nd. If you sell food, use and sell them in \u201ccarton\u201d plates, not plastics.\n\ne. Please give enough garbage cans available for your customers.\n\nWe are counting with you to make a difference. Thanks!\nAndr\xe9s\n\n(photos below: Kip Evans)"
