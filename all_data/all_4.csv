Information,"Last Friday we made a little dent in the amount of trash/plastic/ crap that is in this bay. We unfortunately were not enough to make a huge impact on the sheer quantity of it on the beach even though there were 50 of us! \nThank you to Diamonds International for helping out with this feat, it wasn't easy and it's no where near finished but we made a little difference! \nTo make it interesting the RMP did a presentation before the cleanup and  split up into teams and had a scavenger hunt during the cleaning. Among the things we needed to find were 14 shoes (flipflops), a ball, 3 toothbrushes, a piece of net, 6 pack rings and others!"
Information,"Our Park Ranger based out of Coxen Hole who is responsible for patrolling the Cordelia Banks came across a net spanning several hundred feet between the airport and Dixon Cove. Sadly within the net there were 2 nurse sharks, so badly decomposed that they are barely recognizable. One more net out of the water which is to be added to the bonfire taking place at the end of the week"
Information,"We were able to install 4 fishing moorings around Cordelia Banks. Part of an extensive marine infrastructure funded by CORAL and Port of Roatan, the RMP has also installed snorkel moorings and demarcation markers."
Information,"Turtle meat is still consumed throughout the island and people use nets and spears to catch them. This net was most likely from Crawfish Rock as we have had numerous reports of them from community members. There are undoubtedly dozens more turtle nets being used around Roatan so we ask all boat owners to keep on the look out for lines of small floats inside lagoons , indicating a net. One can only imagine how many turtles have sadly died in this net but thankfully it has now been destroyed and can no longer kill our hawksbill and green turtles."

Information,This video will be used as an educational tool to teach people on the island that lionfish can be safely cleaned and cooked and are a good alternative to eating other reef fish
Information,"large nets will have white styrofoam buoys keeping it afloat, however the smaller ones will seem more inconspicuos as the floats are much smaller and often blue. Keep a look our for sticks stuck into the sand, seagrass, mud or even the reef which are used to keep the net in one place.  Straight or curved lines in the water may often indicate a net floating just at the water line"

Community,"Deba Matherne, The facilities available on Roatan only cater to PET 1 bottles and drink cans and there is a return on the bottles and aluminum cans but it is very little. \n\nPlease do not forget that Honduras is in no way as advanced as the US no matter how many years ago you began gathering bottles for pocket change. \n\nWe are still a developing country and develop we must! \n\nHopefully you can imagine how hard it must be to collect recyclables for pennies a pound when you have no safe  place to sleep at night. These structures would provide sanctuary for many people not only in the US, where you might not see it as a viable option, but worldwide where there are people suffering due to lack of basic human rights. \n\nBrain surgery it is not but common sense would tell you that this is a great option for many people especially in countries where recycling is not even an option."
Information,Confiscated items from 2009

Only people who ""like"" the Marine Park can see these figures and can always email at info@roatanmarinepark.net to get an unbiased response regarding dive shops. This chart is used to congratulate all those business that sell the user fee and are members. With so many shops and with month 4 of the year already gone, you can see trends in who do and don't sell the user fee."
Information,Many of you may have noticed the sharpnose puffers (Canthigaster rostrata) and the Goggle-Eyes (Selar crumenophthalmus) that have been found on the beach this last weekend. \n\nWe (RMP and BICA) have taken samples and are sending them off to the labs for testing. \n\nwe believe it may be a part of the puffer's natural reproductive cycle and a product of the Goggle-Eyes going after an easy meal and eating them. Sharpnose puffers contain tetrodotoxin which is  toxic to most fish and may have caused the Goggle-Eyes' death. \n\nWITH THIS IN MIND PLEASE IF YOU SEE THESE PUFFERS ON THE BEACH EITHER BURY THEM OR PICK THEM UP! THEY COULD BE FATAL TO DOMESTIC PETS/CHILDREN IF CONSUMED!!! \n\nWhen we hear anything we'll be sure to let everyone know!

Information,"The sale of the ""user fee"" is supposed to be promoted by the dive shops to help finance the RMP's programs such as marine infrastructure, patrolling, education, raising environmental awareness etc. Several dive shops mention little or nothing about the RMP other than telling their guests ""not to touch the reef"" which is what PADI tells them to do.

Information,"Beginning in 2006 with 3 schools, the RMP Education Program has so far incorporated 15 education centers from communities all around the island: West End, Sandy Bay, Mud Hole, Corozal, Gravel Bay, Coxen Hole, Los Fuertes, French Harbor, Punta Gorda, Jonesville and Camp Bay. The Program aims not only to bring marine education to the classroom, but to bring the classroom to the reef.  School snorkelling trips, beach clean ups, glass-bottom boat rides and Discover Scuba Diving Experiences allow children to develop deeper understanding of the value of our coral reef and threats to its future survival. More than 2,000 kids were part of our education program in 2008 and the number is increasing in 2009!"
