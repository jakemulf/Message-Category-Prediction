Information,"Thank you Healthy Reefs for Healthy People for launching the Mesoamerican Reef 2015 Report Card today. We were delighted to hear that Honduras was the best ranked from the 4 countries of the Mesoamerican reef, Honduras is ranked at 3.3 on a scale of 1-5 where 1 is ""poor"" and 5 is ""very good"" due to the high live coral cover and high herbivorous fish. The Bay Islands, Swan Islands and Cayos Cochinos were the only subregions to have a ""very good"" and Roatan and Cayos Cochinos scored higher for commercial biomass. Thanks to Honduras' ban on spear and trap fishing we have managed to protect our parrotfish. Our long standing MPA protection, gear restrictions and effective enforcement have contributed to the groupers recovering. Increasing protection for large fish will allow them to grow bigger and produce more off spring, while effective management of Marine Protected Areas generates increased fish biomass and high coral cover provides the structure to support more fish. By following the fisheries rules and regulations, reefs and fishermen will have more fish. It's good to know we are really making a difference, let's keep up the good work!"
