They have made an effort to offer recycling and pay for not only their plastic but cans as well. This DOES NOT include the picking up of the plastic... just the effort to remove it from the island... they are the MAIN reason why Roatan recycles anything... just the yes this is a sneaky way but those are our laws and unfortunately it gives the companies loopholes and even if it was perfectly enforced by the municipality it still would not solve the plastic and trash on our beaches and streets! That is where the communities of Roatan must step up and help out ourselves... if we dont help and respect ourselves, who will?? and why would they?"

We are currently working on a bee project with the community from Corozal, however there are dozens of other communities that need help. many people don't actually own the land they live on and have already illegally cleared the neighbouring hillsides for farming so these programs would be tricky to supervise.

Information,"It is clear that people who are not earning a living from all the tourism generated revenue here on Roatan rely on the sea as a source of food and income. What was once full of conch, lobster, turtles and fish, due to such an increase in the island's population, there are far fewer of all of these inhabitants on the reef. Overfishing is a huge problem here with juveniles of all species of fish harvested, along with the use of nets and spearguns. The reefs are struggling with this increased pressure and the future looks bleak if we don't work more on controlling the ever increasing population who fail to receive the education and awareness which would change their attitude towards the reefs"

Community,"Hello everyone thanks for all your comments. We do patrols during day and also strategic at night some of them are by land others by sea. We try to change our strategies because believe or not poachers are very creative and always find new ways to do their activities. Our rangers normally as soon the capture live organisms the free them around the area that they got them now in this case in my position as Director and coordinator of patrols and seeing the different methods they used I asked the ranger to bring them to West End so I could inspect the animals, take pictures of them in and out the bag and write an adequate report, I decided to release them on Half Moon Bay to avoid more stress to them. Now I want to be clear that this is not a common approach we do believe in releasing them close to the area they where found and we spread them, the only other time we move them is when they are in the popular poaching sites then we find other site where we can insure their survival. I ask the community to not only report this cases to us but also make sure that if poaches come close to your beach let them know that you wont tolerate their activities. Only together we will make a difference. RMP main objective is preserving the Islands treasures and will work hard to achieve it. Thank You for understanding and great job to our ranger that found this bags and conch."

The recipient will be well respected in their field by their peers as well as looked on as a role model within not only their community but within the conservation community and family. \n\nAfter much thought we have unanimously decided that the first ever recipient of the Mark Havey Award of Conservation Excellence will be Mr. Sherman Arch of French Cay. \n\nMr. Sherman began his conservation efforts when he opened his house and property to the preserve the Green Iguana population. Then he expanded his area of conservation to include rescued monkeys, parrots and raccoons and eventually onto the marine area mainly by purchasing sea turtles and keeping them until they could be released safely back onto the reef.  \n\nCurrently he along with family and 10 or so other community members of French Cay have dedicated their lives to protect the bay surrounding Big and Little French Cay. \n\nThank you Mr. Sherman for everything you have done and will do to make Roatan a better place!"

Now don't forget that the photos posted are all the entries and that everyone on FB will vote for the winners of the BEST FIND category only.\nHope that settles any doubts :)"
