However, it is not only our favourite category but the favourite of many of our members and followers. \n\nSo what we have decided is that the Best Find photos will be initially judged by the RMP Staff and then our top picks will be opened for LIKES after that! \n\nAs for how many photos can be submitted it is 6 photos for the normal categories with no more than 2 per category. You can submit as many as \nyou like in the Bonus categories without limitation."

Community,http://www.roatanmarinepark.com/about/our-location/\n
Community,The conch were still alive and were relocated. Mic Campbell The legalities for arresting people and actually imprisoning them is sadly inadequate here. Pretty much any serious crime results in the perpetrator spending only 24hrs up on the hill. We have spent days trying to prosecute people and unfortunately very little ever happens as a result. we do what we can and await the day that 24hrs in jail becomes the minimum time for incarceration.
Community,This is the video that is being shown in Louisiana about the found boaters. We are very happy to have been a part of the search and elated that this search ended in success! \n\nHopefully this will be a lesson to everyone out there that has and is thinking about making that 20 mile crossing ill prepared! We will not always be as lucky as these 9 have been! \n\nhttp://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/Missing-group-in-Honduras-including-La-teen-rescued-by-Coast-Guard/-/9853400/20834026/-/kepovw/-/index.html

Information,"Short Message to business owners prior to Semana Santa!\n\nThe Honduran Swan Islands constitute a chain of three small islands located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, approximately ninety miles off the Honduran coastline. They are the most isolated islands in the region, meaning that they are located as far away from any other island in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile on a scientific expedition, last July I had the privilege of visiting this remote place, hoping to encounter a pristine area where few people have ventured. Although the scene in the Northern portions of the islands where astoundingly beautiful, the story wasn\u2019t the same in the South Side. \n\nEven when only 6 navy officers actually live in the island, the South beaches where unexpectedly covered with plastic trash brought upon the currents. Our cultural bond with plastics is evidently taking the lead, destroying ecosystems and places that we might not even know about yet.\n\nWhether you own a business or not, the message for this Semana Santa, is for all of us to make a little sacrifice and accept to comply with this very simple recommendations.\n\nPlease don\u2019t sell plastic bottles! Alternatives are always there:\n\na. Sell refreshments in cans (which are more reciclable tan plastics).\n\nb. Serve sodas or beers in \u201ccarton\u201d cups, not plastics.\n\nc. If you which to sell water, buy enough 5 gallon containers and get a fountain \u2013 instead, sell re-fills.\n\nd. If you sell food, use and sell them in \u201ccarton\u201d plates, not plastics.\n\ne. Please give enough garbage cans available for your customers.\n\nWe are counting with you to make a difference. Thanks!\nAndr\xe9s\n\n(photos below: Kip Evans)"
