Information,"Short Message to business owners prior to Semana Santa!\n\nThe Honduran Swan Islands constitute a chain of three small islands located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, approximately ninety miles off the Honduran coastline. They are the most isolated islands in the region, meaning that they are located as far away from any other island in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile on a scientific expedition, last July I had the privilege of visiting this remote place, hoping to encounter a pristine area where few people have ventured. Although the scene in the Northern portions of the islands where astoundingly beautiful, the story wasn\u2019t the same in the South Side. \n\nEven when only 6 navy officers actually live in the island, the South beaches where unexpectedly covered with plastic trash brought upon the currents. Our cultural bond with plastics is evidently taking the lead, destroying ecosystems and places that we might not even know about yet.\n\nWhether you own a business or not, the message for this Semana Santa, is for all of us to make a little sacrifice and accept to comply with this very simple recommendations.\n\nPlease don\u2019t sell plastic bottles! Alternatives are always there:\n\na. Sell refreshments in cans (which are more reciclable tan plastics).\n\nb. Serve sodas or beers in \u201ccarton\u201d cups, not plastics.\n\nc. If you which to sell water, buy enough 5 gallon containers and get a fountain \u2013 instead, sell re-fills.\n\nd. If you sell food, use and sell them in \u201ccarton\u201d plates, not plastics.\n\ne. Please give enough garbage cans available for your customers.\n\nWe are counting with you to make a difference.

Community,Cordelia Banks. If you don't know yet how fortunate we are please watch. Hopefully it will shed a little more light on how important it is to patrol 24/7. The reefs need your help! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFwAaAce8MQ
Information,"A large number of the dolphins were born at ARK so they no difference between captivity and freedom. To my knowledge the dolphins are well looked after and the staff at AKR prevent stressful incidents occur as a stressed or unhappy dolphin will not perform. \nIt is completely up to you whether you want your kids to visit the dolphins or not. Some people hate zoos as they house wild animals which were taken from their homes. Many of these dolphins  know no better, are well fed and looked after. \nAKR have been running dolphin encounters for years so its definitely not a cowboy operation. \nHope this helps and enjoy your time on Roatan"
